 (2) direct substitution of farm-based renewable fuels for gasoline in gasoline-powered  internal combustion hybrid electric engines  will result in further reductions in local air  pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil  imports;  (3)  for permanent reductions  in criteria  pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil  imports, Congress should establish as a national goal the development of renewable hydrogen as a clean effective energy carrier;  (4) the development of vehicles powered by  hydrogen derived from domestic renewable  resources such as ethanol, energy crops, agricultural waste, landfill gas, municipal solid  waste, wind power, and  solar electricity,  will—  (A) substantially and permanently reduce  local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions;  (B)  improve the energy security of the  United States; and  (C) create domestic jobs;  (5) notwithstanding paragraph (4), as of the  date of enactment of this Act, the fuel cell  technology required to make the most efficient use of renewable hydrogen is too costly  and has not achieved the reliability necessary for consumer acceptance in the near  term;  (6) in the near term (before affordable and  reliable fuel cell vehicles are developed), hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine  hybrid electric vehicles have been developed  that can achieve more than 90 percent of the  environmental benefits and 100 percent of  the oil import reduction benefits of fuel cell  vehicles;  (7) in addition to robust research and development for fuel cell vehicles, a program  to develop and demonstrate renewable hydrogen production and distribution  technology is justified;  (8) reforming ethanol at a vehicle fueling  station may be the least costly method of  producing renewable hydrogen;

 (2) direct substitution of farm-based renewable fuels for gasoline in gasoline-powered  internal combustion hybrid electric engines  will result in further reductions in local air  pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil  imports;  (3)  for permanent reductions  in criteria  pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil  imports, Congress should establish as a national goal the development of renewable hydrogen as a clean effective energy carrier;  (4) the development of vehicles powered by  hydrogen derived from domestic renewable  resources such as ethanol, energy crops, agricultural waste, landfill gas, municipal solid  waste, wind power, and  solar electricity,  will—  (A) substantially and permanently reduce  local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions;  (B)  improve the energy security of the  United States; and  (C) create domestic jobs;  (5) notwithstanding paragraph (4), as of the  date of enactment of this Act, the fuel cell  technology required to make the most efficient use of renewable hydrogen is too costly  and has not achieved the reliability necessary for consumer acceptance in the near  term;

 Whereas recent census data show that almost 13,000,000 children in the United States  live in families experiencing hunger or food  insecurity;  Whereas the problem of hunger and food  insecurity can be found in rural, suburban,  and urban America, touching nearly every  American community;  Whereas although substantial progress has  been made in reducing the incidence of hunger and food insecurity in the United States,  certain groups, including the working poor,  the elderly, homeless people, children, migrant workers, and Native Americans remain  vulnerable to hunger and the negative effects  of food deprivation;  Whereas the people of the United States  have a long tradition of providing food assistance to hungry people through acts of  private generosity and public support programs;  Whereas the United States Government,  through Federal  food assistance programs  like the Federal Food Stamp Program, child  nutrition programs, and food donation programs, provides essential nutrition support  to millions of low-income people;  Whereas there is a growing awareness of  the important public and private partnership  role  that  community-based organizations,  institutions of faith, and charities provide in  assisting hungry and food insecure people;  Whereas more than 50,000  local community-based organizations rely on the support  and efforts of more than 1,000,000 volunteers  to provide food assistance and services to  millions of vulnerable people;  Whereas a diverse group of organizations,  including America’s Second Harvest,  the  United States Conference of Mayors, and  other organizations have documented substantial increases in requests for emergency  food assistance over the past year; and  Whereas all Americans can help participate in hunger relief efforts in their communities by donating food and money, by volunteering, and by supporting public policies  aimed at reducing hunger: Now, therefore, be  it  Resolved, That the Senate—  (1) designates June 5, 2002, as  Hunger Awareness Day’’;  (2) requests that the President  issue a  proclamation calling upon the people of the  United States to observe ‘‘National Hunger  Awareness Day’’—  ‘‘National  "
